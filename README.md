# gochat

A simple chat web application using Golang.

A work in progress. Going to add authentication soon.

If you're interested then you can clone the repository, install Go and run the following commands in the chat directory.

`go build`

After the code is built, run:

`chat.exe` if you're on Windows and,

`./chat` if you're on Mac/Linux
